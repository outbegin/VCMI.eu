      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re back with new major release! A lot of work has been done to ensure game stability. A number of &amp;ldquo;impossible&amp;rdquo; crash bugs were tracked down and fixed. This opens up chance for better multiplayer support in the future. RMG has undergone huge improvement, it is now not only closely resembling OH3, but also works much faster. Bonus is about 150 random map templates ported from original game and fan favourites.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re happy to give you new version VCMI 0.98. Previous release 0.97 was not very satisfactory, it has a number of issues with AI as well as crashbugs. Luckily now all these problems are solved and you can play new VCMI 0.98 with no problems.
Finally all the spells in game are supported. New additions include missing adventure spells and Earthquake. An important new feature is World View option. You will also notice nice fading effect on picked treasures and adventure map transitions.</description>

      <description>We want to rewrite the entire H3 engine (VCMI is NOT another mod) giving it new possibilities. Years of intensive work resulted in creating application with impressive amount of features. Among current features are:
 Complete gameplay mechanics Almost all objects, abilities, spells and other content Basic battle AI and adventure AI Many GUI improvements: high resolutions, stack queue, creature window Advanced and easy mod support - add new towns, creatures, heroes, artifacts and spells without limits or conflicts Launcher for easy configuration - download mods from our server and install them immediatelly!</description>

      <description>Again, what is VCMI?   In simple words: Remake of Heroes of Might and Magic 3. We use original Heroes 3 graphic, sound and text assets and make new game that is supposed to work 100% same as H3. Everything in VCMI is made from scratch - loading game files, drawing graphics, AI, game mechanics etc. We also plan supporting WoG mod features, but for now there are areas in VCMI that need more attention than WoG features.</description>
